# Password_Generator 

The Password_Generator app allows users to randomly generate new password they can use according to their own specifications. The password generator page is simple and user-friendly allowing users to simply click on a button, answer a few questions and then have a new password displayed for them. This web page uses HTML, CSS and Javascript to appear neat, easy to understand and also easy to interact with.
